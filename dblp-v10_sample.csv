"In this paper, a robust 3D triangular mesh watermarking algorithm based on 3D segmentation is proposed. In this algorithm three classes of watermarking are combined. First, we segment the original image to many different regions. Then we mark every type of region with the corresponding algorithm based on their curvature value. The experiments show that our watermarking is robust against numerous attacks including RST transformations, smoothing, additive random noise, cropping, simplification and remeshing.","['S.

"We studied an autoassociative neural network with dynamic synapses which include a facilitating mechanism. We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.","['Joaquín J. Torres', 'Jesús M. Cortés', 'Joaquín Marro', 'Hilbert J.

"It is well-known that Sturmian sequences are the non ultimately periodic sequences that are balanced over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also characterized by their complexity: they have exactly $(n+1)$ distinct factors of length $n$. A natural generalization of Sturmian sequences is the set of infinite episturmian sequences. These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkel's conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences. It appears that balanced episturmian sequences are all ultimately periodic and they can be classified in 3 families.","['Genevi eve Paquin', 'Laurent Vuillon']",50,"['1c655ee2-067d-4bc4-b8cc-bc779e9a7f10', '2e4e57ca-d190-4bc7-b7ad-2e33aca2f574', '508ea83a-035b-4542-a315-9247c172d255', '666a65af-8657-43f6-b765-f2b72a16726a', '8100bfb7-3f6a-4269-bba8-7c4a6a578570', '8e035cc6-d692-4532-bb3c-a6a34b4db83a', 'e10a00d9-bb59-4f19-8f1c-85917bc03b5f']",A characterization of balanced episturmian sequences,Electronic Journal of Combinatorics,2007,4ab3a4cf-1d96-4ce5-ab6f-b3e19fc260de
"One of the fundamental challenges of recognizing actions is accounting for the variability that arises when arbitrary cameras capture humans performing actions. In this paper, we explicitly identify three important sources of variability: (1) viewpoint, (2) execution rate, and (3) anthropometry of actors, and propose a model of human actions that allows us to investigate all three. Our hypothesis is that the variability associated with the execution of an action can be closely approximated by a linear combination of action bases in joint spatio-temporal space. We demonstrate that such a model bounds the rank of a matrix of image measurements and that this bound can be used to achieve recognition of actions based only on imaged data. A test employing principal angles between subspaces that is robust to statistical fluctuations in measurement data is presented to find the membership of an instance of an action. The algorithm is applied to recognize several actions, and promising results have been obtained.","['Yaser Sheikh', 'Mumtaz Sheikh', 'Mubarak Shah']",221,"['056116c1-9e7a-4f9b-a918-44eb199e67d6', '05ac52a1-dfa2-4c32-9a54-6c1e58cfcca5', '0b2f71cc-6797-445a-82df-5be29945c0a7', '60cf9842-c3aa-463d-a5cf-17fbb8f99ccd', '7a3bb575-8313-4e77-a008-ee5cde444746', '7eda9b91-21f1-490f-8ef2-f94e81c558a4', '905461e4-643b-4da0-a669-f52318b9e126', 'be336575-9974-411d-b637-45440213cbd4', 'be9527aa-97e2-4951-86d1-cc6130cbb777', 'f0d57def-3340-49be-a1c3-cbc996af8dec']",Exploring the space of a human action,international conference on computer vision,2005,4ab3a98c-3620-47ec-b578-884ecf4a6206

"Queueing networks with multiple classes of customers play a fundamental role for evaluating the performance of both software and hardware architectures. The main strength of product–form models, in particular of BCMP queueing networks, is that they combine a flexible formalism with efficient analysis techniques and solution algorithms. In this paper we provide an algorithm that starting from a high–level description of a system, and from the definition of its components in terms of interacting sub–systems, computes a multiple–class and multiple–chain BCMP queueing network. We believe that the strength of this approach is twofold. First, the modeller deals with simplified models, which are defined in a modular and hierarchical way. Hence, we can carry on sensitivity analysis that may easily include structural changes (and not only on the time parameters). Second, maintaining the product–form property allows one to derive the average system performance indices very efficiently.

"A CMOS oscillator employing differential transistor pairs working in Class-C in push-pull configuration is presented. The oscillator exhibits the same advantages enjoyed by complementary topologies on oscillators based on a single differential pair, while yielding a substantial power consumption reduction thanks to the Class-C operation. The phase-noise performance and the fundamental conditions required to keep the transistors working in Class-C are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, for an optimal performance, both nMOS and pMOS transistors should not be pushed into the deep triode region by the instantaneous resonator voltage, and a simple circuit solution is proposed to accommodate a large oscillation swing. A 0.18- μm CMOS prototype of the (voltage-controlled) oscillator displays an oscillation frequency from 6.09 to 7.50 GHz. The phase noise at 2-MHz offset is below -120 dBc/Hz with a power dissipation of 2.2 mW, for a state-of-the-art figure-of-merit ranging from 189 to 191 dBc/Hz.","['Andrea Mazzanti', 'Pietro Andreani']",50,"['0a09db01-264a-4bdf-942c-d33cceb35d3c', '36c942df-7fcb-40b8-b023-a3a4001f632e', '84c00b06-a611-4082-89f7-df2d5540d210', 'a5496509-ebaf-472b-bc83-2e7c503e55bf', 'b8b564ca-0651-4fd4-8db0-0f7710e25ce1', 'bb1ed638-e3c3-46f7-adf9-6977afca564a', 'e3a35338-4747-46f7-b752-5690a5c3c84a', 'f277b0e7-3f23-4a22-ac17-fc6c6019c664']",A Push–Pull Class-C CMOS VCO,IEEE Journal of Solid-state Circuits,2013,4ab3f7cd-140b-4e29-99d4-f4e8006c4f65
"In statistical setting of the pattern recognition problem the number of examples required to approximate an unknown labelling function is linear in the VC dimension of the target learning class. In this work we consider the question whether such bounds exist if consider only computable pattern recognition methods, assuming that the unknown labelling function is also computable. We find that in this case the number of examples required for a computable method to approximate the labelling function not only is not linear, but grows faster (in the VC dimension of the class) than any computable function. No time or space constraints are put on the predictors or target functions; the only resource we consider is the training examples.#R##N##R##N#The task of pattern recognition is considered in conjunction with another learning problem — data compression.

"In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a generating function of its Hamming weight enumerator. It can also be defined for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property. In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an analogue of the Enestrom-Kakeya theorem.",['Koji Chinen'],0,"['02d38c7d-3baf-40e3-86d7-a8884ff503f4', '078e6ac3-f385-42e2-a966-5ca05b98588a', 'b06b90e7-36f4-418a-82b2-656645469cf6', 'b86d2872-8125-4909-957a-d1e0f9cacb90']",An abundance of invariant polynomials satisfying the Riemann hypothesis,Discrete Mathematics,2008,4ab459ce-5f18-4cc0-9627-1dc557eb8b68
"Entity Resolution (ER) is the problem of identifying which records in a database refer to the same real-world entity. An exhaustive ER process involves computing the similarities between pairs of records, which can be very expensive for large datasets. Various blocking techniques can be used to enhance the performance of ER by dividing the records into blocks in multiple ways and only comparing records within the same block. However, most blocking techniques process blocks separately and do not exploit the results of other blocks. In this paper, we propose an  iterative blocking framework  where the ER results of blocks are reflected to subsequently processed blocks. Blocks are now iteratively processed until no block contains any more matching records. Compared to simple blocking, iterative blocking may achieve higher accuracy because reflecting the ER results of blocks to other blocks may generate additional record matches. Iterative blocking may also be more efficient because processing a block now saves the processing time for other blocks. We implement a scalable iterative blocking system and demonstrate that iterative blocking can be more accurate and efficient than blocking for large datasets.","['Steven Euijong Whang', 'David Menestrina', 'Georgia Koutrika', 'Martin Theobald', 'Hector Garcia-Molina']",211,"['0b5e0bfa-12ff-4175-9d65-d8cc62552ae6', '2cba753f-24b1-4b6c-8d36-b9bf66bd1477', '33d18bee-c873-4cf5-8962-e79a032cbdf3', '3960350c-fc91-4fae-83f3-69899d9c8a6f', '5d57c4fa-8dda-4e92-b42b-67f8d16f8602', '717f3af1-aa86-41db-90e5-bfb94ecf8616', '71e35609-693a-4036-9bac-861a7ce7c868', '76c1da70-2949-47c3-aefa-9d703c884cd3', '78001688-d865-4fda-a2eb-d5097c93bbb9', '866e99e1-f1d4-4be9-be12-1f3fe444fc52', '8cf0f572-0507-48cf-9ada-37c152f5810f', '99ac2c24-4d9a-4a96-a9a7-4ada6393677e', '9ff322c1-64c8-49e5-9c23-4b380eff5f10', 'b123d7d1-cced-41cc-a8fc-c710a8f8a736', 'b22383b0-6528-4156-9069-472d895438c3', 'b55b3100-5054-4d25-860d-d3e32fc56d14', 'c9b221ed-7083-4ae7-835c-8e8bd5af22ec', 'fb565ef1-0650-4e55-b68a-1936d8ddb188']",Entity resolution with iterative blocking,international conference on management of data,2009,4ab46288-3a29-471f-95c9-9926df1f93ce
"Performance analysts profile their programs to find methods that are worth optimizing: the ""hot"" methods. This paper shows that four commonly-used Java profilers ( xprof , hprof , jprofile, and yourkit ) often disagree on the identity of the hot methods. If two profilers disagree, at least one must be incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a profiler will mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a cold method with little or no performance improvement.   This paper uses causality analysis to evaluate profilers and to gain insight into the source of their incorrectness. It shows that these profilers all violate a fundamental requirement for sampling based profilers: to be correct, a sampling-based profilermust collect samples randomly.   We show that a proof-of-concept profiler, which collects samples randomly, does not suffer from the above problems. Specifically, we show, using a number of case studies, that our profiler correctly identifies methods that are important to optimize; in some cases other profilers report that these methods are cold and thus not worth optimizing.","['Todd Mytkowicz', 'Amer Diwan', 'Matthias Hauswirth', 'Peter F.

Instead of extracting regions of interest for retargeting, the uninteresting parts are removed from the scene in Shai Avidan and Shamir, A. (2007). This is done by computing the RGB variance within non-overlapping 3times3 blocks and removing the block path with minimal variance cost using dynamic programming.

"Scalable storage architectures allow for the addition of disks to increase storage capacity and/or bandwidth. In its general form, disk scaling also refers to disk removals when either capacity needs to be conserved or old disk drives are retired. Assuming random placement of blocks on multiple nodes of a continuous media server, our optimization objective is to redistribute a minimum number of media blocks after disk scaling. This objective should be met under two restrictions. First, uniform distribution and hence a balanced load should be ensured after redistribution. Second, the redistributed blocks should be retrieved at the normal mode of operation in one disk access and through low complexity computation. We propose a technique that meets the objective, while we prove that it also satisfies both restrictions. The SCADDAR approach is based on using a series of REMAP functions which can derive the location of a new block using only its original location as a basis.","['Ashish Goel', 'Cyrus Shahabi', 'Shu-Yuen Didi Yao', 'Roger Zimmermann']",70,"['1d950f41-7ecc-4243-a2bc-e91242887637', '57868e44-9a01-488a-989f-fd18a57a790f', '60e1ce59-a6a3-49dc-9727-3c02d166188a', '72f144d2-8bfc-4eb1-ba37-8cf9ef190a52', '73c49f25-1710-42b9-bc25-e12c3d47f3de', '756dc97f-4124-4692-bf08-c227c4d6d58f', '9e0fc090-adfe-4482-a1a0-b7037922db10', 'a5385305-4572-443e-bcaa-1297e87aaabb', 'ad9ae838-b7be-4c54-9536-1ba11cf2ff92', 'befc800b-996e-4798-b300-303126ad8fd8', 'e3fc9188-4c99-404e-a22c-7ae7413f0238', 'fd8e4a2e-4e59-4c80-982f-d7ac6db3fe54']",SCADDAR: an efficient randomized technique to reorganize continuous media blocks,international conference on data engineering,2002,4ab50bd7-8e59-4974-a6d0-59a577dcc10d

"Freezing tolerance in plants is obtained during a period of low nonfreezing temperatures before the winter sets on, through a biological process known as cold acclimation. Cold is one of the major stress factors that limits the growth, productivity and distribution of plants, and understanding the mechanism of cold tolerance is therefore important for crop improvement. Expressed sequence tags (EST) analysis is a powerful, economical and time-efficient way of assembling information on the transcriptome. To date, several EST sets have been generated from cold-induced cDNA libraries from several different plant species. In this study we utilize the variation in the frequency of ESTs sampled from different cold-stressed plant libraries, in order to identify genes preferentially expressed in cold in comparison to a number of control sets. The species included in the comparative study are oat (Avena sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, in order to get comparable gene expression estimates across multiple species and data sets, we choose to compare the expression of tentative ortholog groups (TOGs) instead of single genes, as in the normal procedure. We consider TOGs as preferentially expressed if they are detected as differentially expressed by a test statistic and up-regulated in comparison to all control sets, and/or uniquely expressed during cold stress, i.e., not present in any of the control sets. The result of this analysis revealed a diverse representation of genes in the different species. In addition, the derived TOGs mainly represent genes that are long-term highly or moderately expressed in response to cold and/or other stresses.","['Angelica Lindlöf', 'Marcus Bräutigam', 'Aakash Chawade', 'Björn Olsson', 'Olof Olsson']",0,"['9b8ad98f-1db8-4201-8246-cbc0812606d8', 'e5b94864-84e2-4833-9df5-6189c844654a']",Identification of cold-induced genes in cereal crops and arabidopsis through comparative analysis of multiple EST sets,bioinformatics research and development,2007,4ab54610-4947-46c7-bd56-fc672dfba5cc
"This position paper concerns itself with real-time safety critical distributed systems. It presents a computational model that is appropriate for this type of application and architecture. It then defines a resource allocations scheme based upon fixed priority scheduling. Such a scheme has the advantage (over purely static schedules) of supporting greater levels of flexibility and non-determinism, whilst still providing static guarantees of necessary timing behaviour (i.e. end-to-end deadlines through the systems). Priority based communication protocols are investigated, with possible future techniques reviewed.","['Alan Burns', 'Neil C. Audsley', 'Andy J.

"a b s t r a c t The constant pressure–temperature (P–T) flash plays an important role in the modelling of fluid-phase behaviour, and its solution is especially challenging for equations of state in which the volume is expressed as an implicit function of the pressure. We explore the relative merits of solving the P–T flash in two ensembles: mole numbers, pressure and temperature, in which each free-energy evaluation requires the use of a numerical solver; and mole numbers, volume and temperature, in which a direct evaluation of the free-energy is possible. We examine the performance of two algorithms, HELD (Helmholtz free energy Lagrangian dual), introduced in Pereira et al. (2012), and GILD (Gibbs free energy Lagrangian dual), introduced here, for the fluid-phase equilibria of 8 mixtures comprising up to 10 components, using two equations of state. While the reliability of both algorithms is comparable, the computational cost of HELD is consistently lower; this difference becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of components is increased. © 2014 The Authors.

"Virtual position-based routing protocols have many attractive characteristics for wireless sensor networks. Typically, such protocols use a proactive scheme for updating routing tables. Because sensor networks can have very low data rate, sending periodic beacons to update routing tables can be very expensive. Instead, reactive approaches might be more appropriate in such scenarios. MANET-inspired reactive routing protocols do not scale well because of the effort in the order of O(n) for each routing information update. In this paper, we present Reactive Virtual Cord Protocol (RVCP), a data-centric reactive virtual position based routing protocol for use in sensor networks. Route discovery is directed towards the destination and hence there is no need to flood the entire network to discover a route. Our approach is based on Virtual Cord Protocol (VCP), an efficient, virtual relative position based routing protocol that also provides support for data management as known from typical Distributed Hash Table (DHT) services. To minimize the end-to-end delay and energy consumption, we used adaptive techniques for the development of RVCP.","['Abdalkarim Awad', 'Andreas Mitschele-Thiel', 'Falko Dressler']",1,"['0d4d0363-07b5-43b6-976d-955e96044709', '29424b9c-c448-4679-8472-044e701a11ea', '2f4e35f1-6dca-46f6-8157-980564a94da0', '3382adea-17b5-4515-a0a7-043f78493e0e', '5bbcc50b-0f4b-4c51-8487-0630f8400f61', '60fb0dc2-bde3-4714-948e-de0ed12ab460', '6288f6da-12ac-4f71-b3dd-37fe580b6793', '6bb012bc-9e9e-4b8d-8098-9b972e612593', '7bd442a1-fb27-4e38-8635-d4c0367f3e2d', '7d42815c-daac-4c27-a9a3-39bd29536fed', '7f9d2a8a-12d1-4944-8c82-99eade0d7442', '8ee59530-fc2a-4b2f-92d0-c241e654f52c', 'ada4eba5-6923-4b92-bf17-9fd360a90b14', 'd381281a-14a0-4d73-993f-723a06096a09', 'e52fc0f5-b2e0-4ecc-a145-3e4e20178da8']",Reactive Virtual Position-Based Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks,international conference on computer communications and networks,2011,4ab5d145-0ea8-49b5-b517-93677e7cbe88

"In this paper, a weighting-delay-based method is developed for the study of the stability problem of a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with time-varying delay. Different from previous results, the delay interval [0, d(t)] is divided into some variable subintervals by employing weighting delays. Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters. Several examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.","['Huaguang Zhang', 'Zhenwei Liu', 'Guang-Bin Huang', 'Zhanshan Wang']",266,"['11560f85-2543-466f-b338-5ef10a073db7', '14feaffa-1566-44d0-b798-80c027655c1a', '2b258346-2416-4156-abcf-f8f3c3bc99c4', '36739ece-b2b9-4c95-8e96-e1135048101c', '38d20ba0-db8e-47db-ab6b-f2898683a0a1', '4b782405-24db-456f-a058-2b8fd79ea3db', '56d975c5-f372-4eee-8667-1cae480cb57c', '669f9f47-d6bf-462e-b2a6-8300ac07835b', '714a8cc0-486f-4259-bb81-66b5f248e016', '758bcb76-b6a4-415b-8403-1fcd1a8c5643', 'b5af1799-bc84-45f5-823c-193b846455d7', 'b6bbf822-292c-4dfa-a98b-d61b798446cc', 'b76d4f7b-2eac-4eae-8a9d-bd21123e4356', 'bee7d6d4-1d2f-4b8b-951e-466c8e67785b', 'd32e8c91-9c64-438b-bee6-2c89ddb2db0a', 'd8263bb4-5ecb-454a-96b0-fb9a84be03b9', 'dc0ffeb4-7087-4f36-b599-43bb8de95ad1', 'f40a5ee9-78d1-40c9-ae7f-bc4cfc143624', 'f93b2e01-ba5c-47c3-94f3-de9ac10991d9']",Novel Weighting-Delay-Based Stability Criteria for Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,2010,4ab5e3f4-9b58-4fbb-9bde-ee2f2185cc61
"Search for information is no longer exclusively limited within the native language of the user, but is more and more extended to other languages. This gives rise to the problem of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), whose goal is to find relevant information written in a different language to a query. In addition to the problems of monolingual information retrieval (IR), translation is the key problem in CLIR: one should translate either the query or the documents from a language to another. However, this translation problem is not identical to full-text machine translation (MT): the goal is not to produce a human-readable translation, but a translation suitable for finding relevant documents. Specific translation methods are thus required. The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive description of the specifi c problems arising in CLIR, the solutions proposed in this area, as well as the remaining problems. The book starts with a general description of the monolingual IR and CLIR problems. Different classes of approaches to translation are then presented: approaches using an MT system, dictionary-based translation and approaches based on parallel and comparable corpora. In addition, the typical retrieval effectiveness using different approaches is compared. It will be shown that translation approaches specifically designed for CLIR can rival and outperform high-quality MT systems. Finally, the book offers a look into the future that draws a strong parallel between query expansion in monolingual IR and query translation in CLIR, suggesting that many approaches developed in monolingual IR can be adapted to CLIR. The book can be used as an introduction to CLIR. Advanced readers can also find more technical details and discussions about the remaining research challenges in the future. It is suitable to new researchers who intend to carry out research on CLIR.",['Jian-Yun Nie'],108,"['05da32dc-92b9-49a6-86f0-54b6dfc51502', '0d2d8a21-065a-4f1f-a167-4eeb8222ca3c', '17137631-a0ab-48e6-8ffb-607ec171f5a5', '333a3435-4b92-4958-92c9-ec3ac586c063', '34d0159e-4244-474f-a9cf-758b0ebb5ecb', '41fc1b12-bc24-4259-b263-4792ca3572a7', '48bc5327-f3a0-4efc-860f-8ef399c43f77', '49945432-7716-4bbf-af7b-c164405548b3', '5443ee2f-a083-4829-bfd3-b92e50b6d78e', '56bdde8a-8fcf-46e0-a426-ce2d695d4e62', '6741ecf3-e230-44a8-9ad0-a2ca2804b93e', '7f2449b4-c535-4d5a-a322-56cc7cffd463', '808c6e5d-4f8a-4aae-9251-0daa41e97f81', '81e1e9ee-2fa2-42ff-8880-b3c66423f276', '81f773c9-9844-43b5-8a63-f9e1f6e1ace8', '88aac5cb-119b-4c92-8271-d94d51e18b90', '894abe0d-19ac-44cc-9e25-d8f4ce1ee44f', '8cfd8f8d-2580-47e6-8e97-7cb448f292a9', '934cae12-e8ed-4394-aad0-5b0148113804', '9bdbf6d6-db2b-4114-969a-37b4e03993b0', 'a26bb4d3-8093-47e5-b755-efed705c4bbd', 'a3b4fc64-334a-44ac-8485-f8d8ca866fe5', 'b535d6b7-ec76-45d1-a35b-38d38dcaa976', 'c388859a-bdcf-408c-ad63-3754a3b989da', 'cce3336d-27a2-4737-b4df-133d8db7dd71', 'eb306335-b866-47c2-a410-d6d2c177bafe', 'f450b6e2-3ae2-46f2-804a-42d4518d956d', 'f4be32eb-646b-4d3f-aec7-8dad39edb522', 'f8f0f0d6-30e6-4581-8f05-1f6204fd43b3']",Cross-Language Information Retrieval,Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies,2010,4ab5e4bd-08e2-4007-825c-d34ce7cb231f

"The performance of a multihop wireless network is typically affected by the interference caused by transmissions in the same network. In a statistical fading environment, the interference effects become harder to predict. Information sources in a multihop wireless network can improve throughput and delay performance of data streams by implementing interference-aware packet injection mechanisms. Forcing packets to wait at the head of queues and coordinating packet injections among different sources enable effective control of copacket interference. In this paper, throughput and delay performance in interference-limited multihop networks is analyzed. Using nonlinear probabilistic hopping models, waiting times which jointly optimize throughput and delay performances are derived. Optimal coordinated injection strategies are also investigated as functions of the number of information sources and their separations. The resulting analysis demonstrates the interaction of performance constraints and achievable capacity in a wireless multihop network.","['Ahmed Bader', 'Eylem Ekici']",14,"['0005fd5c-a351-4527-8f92-c05785cbaa1a', '05bf2d5c-d02c-4fba-a284-6274613c4573', '072bf77e-8d9b-4325-9f75-ae52d23ecb2a', '2b837b12-4500-4d40-8b07-7dece11a2563', '54501e11-a547-41e7-bc2c-b1ed416a3960', '886d74c8-abc3-45c8-a7fa-39d492bba528', '8cc9ea80-563f-4e62-bda9-8ff6d71cf6ae', '8e76b153-4a9a-4fa1-b346-1dc3f47ad505', '8f597291-22a7-40f5-9ab5-587ce00bacc5', 'a301962a-6d47-4fcc-9a89-5c67e1fac20f', 'b4543ef2-2b22-4fd8-b9b2-8d75f66cd8b9', 'b5c2c141-a999-46fa-8b97-ef1863e206fc', 'f3977629-ce12-4503-95dd-f57929ca92c9', 'fe9a64a7-aa51-4435-82b7-64fb2a63ed6d']",Performance optimization of interference-limited multihop networks,IEEE\/ACM Transactions on Networking,2008,4ab62e1f-0ed3-42fc-bfd4-64d255150506
"We propose Action-Reaction Learning as an approach for analyzing and synthesizing human behaviour. This paradigm uncovers causal mappings between past and future events or between an action and its reaction by observing time sequences. We apply this method to analyze human interaction and to subsequently synthesize human behaviour. Using a time series of perceptual measurements, a system automatically discovers correlations between past gestures from one human participant (action) and a subsequent gesture (reaction) from another participant. A probabilistic model is trained from data of the human interaction using a novel estimation technique, Conditional Expectation Maximization (CEM). The estimation uses general bounding and maximization to monotonically find the maximum conditional likelihood solution. The learning system drives a graphical interactive character which probabilistically predicts a likely response to a user's behaviour and performs it interactively. Thus, after analyzing human interaction in a pair of participants, the system is able to replace one of them and interact with a single remaining user.","['Tony Jebara', 'Alex Pentland']",76,"['4d9393e3-9936-4bd4-8da2-8d3b0360ef93', '528f4f4d-7995-48ca-8e9a-83182d9d1c36', '56e5ed17-8b83-4493-898c-3282c07c4013', '57eadb55-c2fa-42e1-a0c4-9da5e1658ff9', '5c082884-b447-4c89-bdc7-7fd0c57c4c13', '62f26948-5305-49da-b0e6-c0206afb33dc', '838ef012-ce45-4921-b1eb-4f419462561a', '95c6635e-6828-468b-883a-d4f4723e5a9c', '99cd9eb6-70e8-4b6e-99db-79520995554c', 'c5b62464-c36b-49a5-ab53-563094b25c07']",Action Reaction Learning: Automatic Visual Analysis and Synthesis of Interactive Behaviour,international conference on computer vision systems,1999,4ab63381-d9bd-4be4-aa89-bb5cab20295e

Next, we compute the exact delays of combinational circuits for transition delay and delay by sequences of vectors. We show that delays by sequences of vectors and floating (or viability) delays are invariant under both bounded and unbounded gate delay models.

In our calculus, a MANET node can locally broadcast messages to a group of nodes within its physical transmission range. The group probability is also introduced since two distinct nodes within different groups should receive messages from the same sender with different possibilities. Our calculus naturally captures essential features of MANETs, i.e., local broadcast, mobility and probability. Moreover, we give a formal operational semantics of the calculus in terms of the labeled transition system and define the notion of open bisimulation.

"A semiblind method is proposed for simultaneously estimating the carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) and channels of an uplink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system. By incorporating the CFOs into the transmitted symbols and channels, the MIMO-OFDM with CFO is remodeled into an MIMO-OFDM without CFO. The known blind method for channel estimation (Zeng and Ng in 2004) (Y. H. Zeng and T. S. Ng, ldquoA semi-blind channel estimation method for multi-user multi-antenna OFDM systems,rdquo IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 52, no. 5, pp. 1419-1429, May 2004.) is then directly used for the remodeled system to obtain the shaped channels with an ambiguity matrix. A pilot OFDM block for each user is then exploited to resolve the CFOs and the ambiguity matrix. Two dedicated pilot designs, periodical and consecutive pilots, are discussed. Based on each pilot design and the estimated shaped channels, two methods are proposed to estimate the CFOs. As a result, based on the second-order statistics (SOS) of the received signal and one pilot OFDM block, the CFOs and channels are found simultaneously. Finally, a fast equalization method is given to recover the signals corrupted by the CFOs.","['Yonghong Zeng', 'Abdul Rahim Leyman', 'Tung-Sang Ng']",50,"['0b9c7b31-9a00-448a-897e-8b1fec6b4016', '13051746-a7cf-4c0b-8853-7e8d3b591aac', '1dc8d7b8-cd52-4e4e-98fd-6f07aae169da', '1e1557e2-9648-457f-9eb9-d1a875d3b97a', '26916931-25c5-4ede-a21c-d50dee62153f', '442b4a58-1d22-4f63-8f07-d7d38d4013e9', '4d5e6dac-fca0-4d63-a700-b0e2d592b204', '50fbef46-1b72-4e0c-b330-cf7b5c2043be', '5294ba9d-7d58-441b-9d7e-2cf62c180df4', '540add15-c089-4dc3-aba0-8e84260ff115', '5fe100d5-0a35-4cbd-9370-c765969f432a', '6600dd62-3848-45b2-afdf-ed5c36b95f31', '67363078-a977-4960-b409-67240ec81161', '7c404115-67de-4391-b2ce-4f96fccca185', 'aa6c34aa-4a2c-47b5-bd7e-39581ee26d84', 'd3c063da-1971-42d9-a8c8-c848b4f1aef9', 'da76a005-ad94-4711-a2ec-69cc936cc7bf', 'ec185fee-a1f0-45a8-bf50-97691591373b', 'ede3111c-69bf-48cc-b0cd-c612d53e0c4b', 'ffabadcc-eb3d-4833-9f44-90d05b77af6c']",Joint Semiblind Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for Multiuser MIMO–OFDM Uplink,IEEE Transactions on Communications,2007,4ab7247f-7956-47b4-b0e0-67a60907c248

"This paper computes and analyzes the natural compliance of fixturing and grasping arrangements. Traditionally, linear-spring contact models have been used to determine the natural compliance of multiple contact arrangements. However, these models are not supported by experiments or elasticity theory. We derive a closed-form formula for the stiffness matrix of multiple contact arrangements that admits a variety of nonlinear contact models, including the well-justified Hertz model. The stiffness matrix formula depends on the geometrical and material properties of the contacting bodies and on the initial loading at the contacts. We use the formula to analyze the relative influence of first- and second-order geometrical effects on the stability of multiple contact arrangements. Second-order effects, i.e., curvature effects, are often practically beneficial and sometimes lead to significant grasp stabilization. However, in some contact arrangements, curvature has a dominant destabilizing influence. Such contact arrangements are deemed stable under an all-rigid body model but, in fact, are unstable when the natural compliance of the contacting bodies is taken into account. We also consider the combined influence of curvature and contact preloading on stability. Contrary to conventional wisdom, under certain curvature conditions, higher preloading can increase rather than decrease grasp stability. Finally, we use the stiffness matrix formula to investigate the impact of different choices of contact model on the assessment of the stability of multiple contact arrangements. While the linear-spring model and the more realistic Hertz model usually lead to the same stability conclusions, in some cases, the two models lead to different stability results.","['Qiao Lin', 'Joel W.

"Motivation: For establishing prognostic predictors of various diseases using DNA microarray analysis technology, it is desired to find selectively significant genes for constructing the prognostic model and it is also necessary to eliminate non-specific genes or genes with error before constructing the model.#R##N##R##N#Results: We applied projective adaptive resonance theory (PART) to gene screening for DNA microarray data.

The model performance was evaluated through comparison with a conventional screening signal-to-noise (S2N) method or nearest shrunken centroids (NSC) method. The FNN-SWEEP predictor with PART screening could discriminate classes of acute leukemia in blinded data with 97.1% accuracy and classes of lung cancer with 90.0% accuracy, while the predictor with S2N was only 85.3 and 70.0% or the predictor with NSC was 88.2 and 90.0%, respectively. The results have proven that PART was superior for gene screening.#R##N##R##N#Availability: The software is available upon request from the authors.#R##N##R##N#Contact: honda@nubio.nagoya-u.ac.jp","['Hiro Takahashi', 'Takeshi Kobayashi', 'Hiroyuki Honda']",50,"['0742bed7-389c-4734-800a-c1694a373585', '8a54e596-5c64-4b50-a52b-e7cee97bce84', 'a24cb345-f658-4e58-b081-809f36d67388']",Construction of robust prognostic predictors by using projective adaptive resonance theory as a gene filtering method,Bioinformatics,2005,4ab7b6e2-1cff-472a-9637-95c7938be3e1
"The connection between minimum entropy control and risk-sensitive control for linear time-varying systems is investigated. For time-invariant systems, the entropy functional and the linear exponential quadratic Gaussian cost are the same. In this paper, it is shown that this is not true for general time varying systems. It does hold, however, when the system admits a state-space representation.","['Marc A. Peters', 'Pablo A.

"Two-operand binary addition is the most widely used arithmetic operation in modern datapath designs. To improve the efficiency of this operation, it is desirable to use an adder with good performance and area tradeoff characteristics. This paper presents an efficient carry-lookahead adder architecture based on the parallel-prefix computation graph. In our proposed method, we define the notion of triple-carry-operator, which computes the generate and propagate signals for a merged block which combines three adjacent blocks. We use this in conjunction with the classic approach of the carry-operator to compute the generate and propagate signals for a merged block combining two adjacent blocks. The timing-driven nature of the proposed design reduces the depth of the adder. In addition, we use a ripple-carry type of structure in the nontiming critical portion of the parallel-prefix computation network. These techniques help produce a good timing-area tradeoff characteristic. The experimental results indicate that our proposed adder is significantly faster than the popular Brent-Kung adder with some area overhead. On the adder hand, the proposed adder also shows marginally faster performance than the fast Kogge-Stone adder with significant area savings.","['S. Das', 'Sunil P.

"An intelligent control stand-alone doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system using proportional-integral-derivative neural network (PIDNN) is proposed in this study. This system can be applied as a stand-alone power supply system or as the emergency power system when the electricity grid fails for all sub-synchronous, synchronous and super-synchronous conditions. The rotor side converter is controlled using the field-oriented control to produce three-phase stator voltages with constant magnitude and frequency at different rotor speeds. Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. Both the network structure and on-line learning algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified through experimentation.","['Faa-Jeng Lin', 'Jonq-Chin Hwang', 'Kuang-Hsiung Tan', 'Zong-Han Lu', 'Yung-Ruei Chang']",5,"['1297ec68-9763-44a9-b60e-880ee359cb43', '5863265c-8808-433b-8335-b833c7906d42', '65033205-8fd6-4992-aa02-ef948364d06e', '72c969e4-2002-450f-9fa2-3af233f0e4f9', '88d5ab29-899f-4251-a766-218459fb3a33', '94bc995a-f5ba-48d3-a85c-6a0e6ff4dc68', 'a1044362-e073-47f7-936c-c6d9040db46e', 'a643d397-25b4-4002-8f6b-92b3ea83d508', 'a83f737b-160d-414f-93a0-1cc57b00d410', 'b2c8fd9d-be83-4570-8475-7df33f169978', 'd1a2ab37-610e-498e-9da8-263ec5a464e3', 'efaf7e17-6b68-4f9f-8550-0ee758578ede', 'f5010b13-da80-4406-8966-0ac0464d8fde', 'f932d94a-6da0-45ec-9638-180255f14760', 'f966c2a0-2956-4dd9-9efd-5166e71dea42']",Control of Doubly-Fed Induction Generator System Using PIDNNs,international conference on machine learning and applications,2010,4ab7fd62-8f72-4845-a1fb-77e2d9c2a733
"A tripartite authenticated key agreement protocol is designed for three entities to communicate securely over an open network particularly with a shared key. Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) allows the participants to share a session key using a human memorable password only. In this paper, A password-based authenticated tripartite key exchange protocol(3-PAKE) is presented in the standard model. The security of the protocol is reduced to theDecisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) problem, and the protocol provides not only the properties of forward secrecy, but also resistance against known key attacks. The proposed protocol is more efficient than the similar protocols in terms of both communication and computation.","['Guomin Li', 'Dake He', 'Wei Guo']",0,"['1ee68967-435a-4b08-9d5e-bbf1c98bdc92', '23488a90-32d1-4b37-8328-9d206f18a128', '6947b732-592a-48fd-a6fc-cd39c0f758e0', '7293abd4-5dab-4116-8401-26902dbe8976', '7e818da1-ec5a-4944-8c01-5b0a673a48ba', 'aabd8f07-c961-4df7-98b9-759c8667497c', 'deb72cac-8e58-458b-8d98-93ab35047302', 'e629a1d0-2366-4d7e-ab57-a98afae46c3e']",Password-based tripartite key exchange protocol with forward secrecy,rough sets and knowledge technology,2008,4ab80354-5db3-4d6c-b71a-b632ad55afcc
The utility of high-altitude balloons as a learning technology to facilitate education in several disciplines is considered in this paper. The role that a high-altitude balloon can play as a learning technology is discussed and its utility in this role is considered. The need for a formal design framework for high-altitude ballooning is also discussed. A framework for the assessment of high-altitude ballooning in supporting an undergraduate-level course is evaluated and an assessment using this framework is conducted. The paper concludes with a discussion of techniques that can be used to broaden access to high-altitude ballooning in education.,['Jeremy Straub'],0,['17f29f2b-9f2f-42d1-82c7-ebd5f3a5c9e1'],Evaluation of high-altitude balloons as a learning technology,International Journal of Learning Technology,2015,4ab82679-435a-4c16-a12e-26a9e153172c
"We present a new method for segmenting actions into primitives and classifying them into a hierarchy of action classes. Our scheme learns action classes in an unsupervised manner using examples recorded by multiple cameras. Segmentation and clustering of action classes is based on a recently proposed motion descriptor which can be extracted efficiently from reconstructed volume sequences. Because our representation is independent of viewpoint, it results in segmentation and classification methods which are surprisingly efficient and robust. Our new method can be used as the first step in a semi-supervised action recognition system that will automatically break down training examples of people performing sequences of actions into primitive actions that can be discriminatingly classified and assembled into high-level recognizers.","['Daniel Weinland', 'Rémi Ronfard', 'Edmond Boyer']",81,"['34e8e262-7d14-4476-862c-e4d63cc89847', '606cf3f6-c684-4aeb-89c5-ca5a80aac35a', '6bce238c-31af-4a32-b946-33ea41106c39', '7559d44c-9be7-4006-8151-c005fb6d2d81', '7709c157-24a2-4c1e-a71e-80e41870fb9c', '9ed5fa2c-555f-43c4-a0d6-6a17720ce6c0', '9f685db8-0510-479d-84fb-9855e59088d0', 'b44cb43a-420b-4001-a264-dd9a2f800bd9', 'bea599f9-f381-4047-95cb-a36f4ee6833f', 'dc530f5b-3d53-4a76-b344-d17d8ebb6dba', 'ea0481c6-5a8d-40ea-b0d4-a25469d4cd07', 'f05c8f6c-b49c-4a9f-8655-eac2dca6f1f4', 'f164fda9-7217-498f-ac19-0c44344d8ef5']",Automatic Discovery of Action Taxonomies from Multiple Views,computer vision and pattern recognition,2006,4ab82bb2-7785-4832-b3eb-a38471b58d07
"Viral integration plays an important role in the development of malignant diseases. Viruses differ in preferred integration site and flanking sequence. Viral integration sites (VIS) have been found next to oncogenes and common fragile sites. Understanding the typical DNA features near VIS is useful for the identification of potential oncogenes, prediction of malignant disease development and assessing the probability of malignant transformation in gene therapy. Therefore, we have built a database of human disease-related VIS (Dr.VIS, http://www.scbit.org/dbmi/drvis) to collect and maintain human disease-related VIS data, including characteristics of the malignant disease, chromosome region, genomic position and viral–host junction sequence. The current build of Dr.VIS covers about 600 natural VIS of 5 oncogenic viruses representing 11 diseases. Among them, about 200 VIS have viral–host junction sequence.","['Xin Zhao', 'Qi Liu', 'Qingqing Cai', 'Yanyun Li', 'Congjian Xu', 'Yixue Li', 'Zuofeng Li', 'Xiaoyan Zhang']",14,"['225cf426-535c-424a-a132-a5e64172d4e1', '2c539143-aa90-42f0-b7d1-531f93158c7f', '34cd7b3d-01a1-4f8d-bd49-537d43e82ed8', '5601d014-87fe-4bcb-bca0-a0af1e3aeaa8', 'e123f551-5229-4592-9453-0f7c67b6bf85']",Dr.VIS: a database of human disease-related viral integration sites,Nucleic Acids Research,2012,4ab82e6e-94e0-47b7-b20c-1eb70aabd346
