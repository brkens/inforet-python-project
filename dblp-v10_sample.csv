"In this paper, a robust 3D triangular mesh watermarking algorithm based on 3D segmentation is proposed. In this algorithm three classes of watermarking are combined. First, we segment the original image to many different regions. Then we mark every type of region with the corresponding algorithm based on their curvature value. The experiments show that our watermarking is robust against numerous attacks including RST transformations, smoothing, additive random noise, cropping, simplification and remeshing.","['S.

"We studied an autoassociative neural network with dynamic synapses which include a facilitating mechanism. We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.","['Joaquín J. Torres', 'Jesús M. Cortés', 'Joaquín Marro', 'Hilbert J.

"It is well-known that Sturmian sequences are the non ultimately periodic sequences that are balanced over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also characterized by their complexity: they have exactly $(n+1)$ distinct factors of length $n$. A natural generalization of Sturmian sequences is the set of infinite episturmian sequences. These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkel's conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences. It appears that balanced episturmian sequences are all ultimately periodic and they can be classified in 3 families.","['Genevi eve Paquin', 'Laurent Vuillon']",50,"['1c655ee2-067d-4bc4-b8cc-bc779e9a7f10', '2e4e57ca-d190-4bc7-b7ad-2e33aca2f574', '508ea83a-035b-4542-a315-9247c172d255', '666a65af-8657-43f6-b765-f2b72a16726a', '8100bfb7-3f6a-4269-bba8-7c4a6a578570', '8e035cc6-d692-4532-bb3c-a6a34b4db83a', 'e10a00d9-bb59-4f19-8f1c-85917bc03b5f']",A characterization of balanced episturmian sequences,Electronic Journal of Combinatorics,2007,4ab3a4cf-1d96-4ce5-ab6f-b3e19fc260de
